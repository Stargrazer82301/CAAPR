# CAAPR (the Comprehensive & Adaptable Aperture Photometry Routine)

CAAPR (the Comprehensive & Adaptable Aperture Photometry Routine) is an aperture photometry pipeline, designed with multiwavelength extragalactic astronomy in mind. It's written in Python 2.7. (Yes, I know that Python 2.7 is *soo* 2016; I'll get around to updating it some day. Meanwhile, if you want to avoid compatibility issues, I recommend using a [virtual environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html); it's surprisingly easy.)

CAAPR was created to be able to generate aperture-matched photometry that is truly cross-comparable, even in the face of the broad range of data types that are required for multiwavelength astronomy â€“ producing fluxes ***and uncertainties*** in a consistent manner, despite the enormous variation in the characteristics of observations ranging from ultraviolet to infrared to microwave. CAAPR features a novel method for reliably extrapolating the aperture noise for observations that cover a very limited amount of background.

CAAPR is designed to be an end-to-end photometry pipeline; the user sets it running, and it outputs a couple of CSV tables describing the results, along with some thumbnail images illustrating the apertures. Of course, astronomers tend to distrust "black box" code, so CAAPR is designed with a host of options and switches that the user can adjust, if they want. This makes CAAPR more of a "grey box" pipeline.

CAAPR is described in detail in [C J R Clark et al. (2018)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...609A..37C), and is a development of the pipeline first used in [C J R Clark et al. (2015)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.452..397C). Photometry produced using CAAPR has also been presented in [De Vis et al. (2017a)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1705.02340), [Keenan (2017)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PhDT........54K), and Saintonge et al. (*in prep.*).

## Installation

1. [Download](https://github.com/Stargrazer82301/CAAPR/archive/master.zip) the zip archive containing CAAPR from the GitHub repository, and extract it to a temporary location of your choice.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to extracted directory that contains setup.py
3. Install using the terminal command `pip install -e . --user` (Whilst you can try installing using the more common `python setup.py install` route, this sometimes hits compatability issues, whereas the pip local installer seems more robust.)
4. Download and install the ChrisFuncs package, found [here](https://github.com/Stargrazer82301/ChrisFuncs), which CAAPR depends 
upon. Like CAAPR it can be downloaded, extracted, and installed very straightforwardly.

## Example Usage

The CAAPR repository has a folder called CAAPR_Example. This contains an example script, and some example data. Once CAAPR has been installed, the example script `CAAPR_Example.py` can be run to provide the user with an basic example of CAAPR in action. 

`CAAPR_Example.py` just imports CAAPR,  and then calls the `CAAPR.CAAPR_Main.Run` function which runs the pipeline. The `CAAPR.CAAPR_Main.Run` function has a two required keyword arguments (`sources_table_path` and `bands_table_path`), plus a number of option keyword arguments which allow the user to adjust the pipeline's behavour. The various arguments are as follows:
 - `sources_table_path` [**str, required**] The path (relative or absolute) to a CSV file that provides the details of each target source that CAAPR should process. For column details see subsection below.
 - `bands_table_path` [**str, required**] The path (relative or absolute) to a CSV file that provides the details of each band (ie GALEX FUV, SDSS r, etc) that CAAPR should process. For column details see subsection below.
 - `output_dir_path` [**str**, default = current working directory] The path to a directory where the output tables and thumbnail images produced by CAAPR will be saved. If the directory does not already exist, it will be created.
 - `temp_dir_path` [**str**, default = current working directory] The path to a directory that CAAPR will use for storing temporary working files whilst it is running. If the directory does not already exist, it will be created.
 - `fit_apertures` [**bool**, default = True] If True, CAAPR will fit apertures, and save the apertures to the file named in the `aperture_table_path` kwarg (see below). If False, CAAPR will assume the `aperture_table_path` file is a pre-existing table containing an aperture for each source, and will skip aperture-fitting and progress straight to the photometry phase (assuming the `do_photom` is set to True; see below). 
 - `aperture_table_path` [**str/None**, default = within `output_dir_path`] The path to a CSV file that will contain the apertures for each source (see details for fit_apertures kwarg above); if None, a file will be created automatically in the directory given by `output_dir_path`. For column details see subsection below.
 - `do_photom` [**bool**, default = True] If this is set to False and the `fit_apertures` kwarg is set to True, CAAPR will just fit apertures, and not bother doing any actual photometry.
 - `photom_table_path` [**str/None**, default = within `output_dir_path`] The path to a CSV file where CAAPR will save the measured photometry for each source; if None, a file will be created automatically in the directory given by `output_dir_path`. For column details see subsection below.
 - `expansion_factor` [**float**, default = 1.25] When `fit_apertures = True`, CAAPR's aperture-fitting process will automatically expand the best-fit aperture by this factor, in order to encompass low-SNR emission at the periphery of each target source (see Section 3.4 of C J R Clark et al, 2018).
 - `polysub` [**bool**, default = True] Whether or not CAAPR will attempt to fit and subtract a sky polynomial to remove large-scale background from maps (see Section 3.3 of C J R Clark et al, 2018).
 - `starsub` [**bool**, default = True] Whether or not CAAPR will attempt to remove stars from the input maps (see Section 3.2 of C J R Clark et al, 2018). This can be enabled/disabled for particular bands/sources `bands_table_path` and `sources_table_path` tables.
- `extinction_corr` [**bool**, default = True], Whether or not CAAPR should correct fluxes for foreground Galactic extinction (see Section 3.6 of C J R Clark et al, 2018),
- `parallel` [**bool**, default = True], # Whether CAAPR should operate in parallel, processing multiple bands simultaneously for each source. The number of parallel threads employed is given by the `n_proc` kwarg.
- `n_proc` [**int**, default = number of available threads, minus 2] If `parallel = True`, CAAPR will use this many CPU threads when processing each source.
- `thumbnails` [**bool**, default = true] Whether CAAPR should produce thumbnail images to illustrate the photometric apertures used (see Figure 6 of C J R Clark et al, 2018); these images will be placed in the output directory defined by `output_dir_path`.
- `verbose` [**bool**, default = True] Whether CAAPR should print verbose output to the console, to update the user on its progress.
- `messy` [**bool**, default = False] If this is set to True, CAAPR will not delete the contents of the temporary folder (defined by `temp_dir_path`) after each source has been processed. This is useful if the user wishes to inspect the star- and background-subtracted maps. Note that if this is set to True, the thumbnail images produced when `thumbnails ==True` may look a bit ugly, with too much whitespace.
 
### Sources Table

CAAPR requires a source table, which should be in CSV format (with a one-line header of the column names, described below), in order to operature. When calling CAAPR, the source table is pointed to using the `sources_table_path` kwarg, described above. An example of a sources table can be found in the CAAPR_Example folder of the CAAPR respository. The columns in the table should be as follows:
 - `name` The name of the source.
 - `ra` The right ascension of the source, in decimal degrees.
 - `dec` The declination of the source, in decimal degrees.
 - `aperture_bands_exclude` A semicolon-separated list of bands which should not be used for aperture fitting in the case of this source. For example, if know there is a bright SMG right next to a particular source, you might exclude the 350um and 500um bands from aperture fitting; this would be done by entering `SPIRE_250;SPIRE_500` here. This column can be left blank for any source.
 - `photom_bands_exclude` A semicolon-separated list of bands which should not be used for photometry in the case of this source. For example, you might have an old optical photographic plate scan image of this source that you want to use for aperture-fitting, but which is no use for photometry. This column can be left blank for any source.
 - `starsub_bands_exclude` A semicolon-separated list of bands for which CAAPR should not attempt star subtraction. For example, the star subtraction sometimes performs badly, and does more harm than good in a particular band, for a particular source. This column can be left blank for any source.
 - `fitting_min_semimaj_arcsec` A float describing the minimum semimajor axis of the photometric aperture that should be fitted for a given source. This is in case you have an *a priori* reason to want CAAPR to fit a photometric aperture of at least a certain size for a given soruce. This column can be left blank for any source.
